- Kaggle aoe2.net dataset to analyze balance in an RTS case study

Scraped Data
- steamdb.info/{player-count-info-for-games} and /{patches-for-aoe2}

Determine how to create an RTS game that continues to draw players for many years, potentially leading to increased sales over time and potential for paid ""sequels""/DLCs to the game

Hypotheses
1. Focusing on creating a balance/fairness will reduce customer churn or increase usage of software (players will play more or keep playing due to having a fair and competitive game)
2. Creating new content through DLCs will maintain interest over time"
