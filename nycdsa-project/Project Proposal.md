# Project Proposal

Help define product strategy for a real-time strategy game developer firm through data analysis.

Determine how to create an RTS game that continues to draw players for many years, potentially leading to increased sales over time and potential for paid "sequels"/DLCs to the game

### *Audience/Primary Stakeholder*

David K - Head of Product, TinyStrategyGames

## *Problem/Context*

Game development is expensive and many games lose players within months of a launch. Keeping players engaged over time is difficult and few RTS games have longevity the likes of *Starcraft* or the *Age of Empires* series. TinyStrategyGames would like to emulate the success of these long-lasting games, but has to answer to Venture Capitalists looking to make a quick buck. Head of Product, David K. has asked Junior Data Monkey, Rishi G., to look into what makes RTS games successful so he can convince the VCs to fund the type of RTS game TinyStrategyGames wishes to make.

## *Hypotheses*

1. Focusing on creating a balance/fairness will reduce customer churn or increase usage of software (players will play more or keep playing due to having a fair and competitive game)
2. Creating new content through DLCs will maintain interest over time (this seems obvious...?"

## *Datasets*

- [Kaggle Age of Empires II:DE dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jerkeeler/age-of-empires-ii-de-match-data) - to analyze balance in an RTS case study
